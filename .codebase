  5 |    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  6 | 
  7 |    1. Definitions.
  8 | 
  9 |       "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
 10 |       and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 11 | 
 12 |       "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
 13 |       the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 14 | 
 15 |       "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
 16 |       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
 17 |       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
 18 |       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
 19 |       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
 20 |       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 21 |       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 22 | 
 23 |       "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
 24 |       exercising permissions granted by this License.
 25 | 
 26 |       "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
 27 |       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 28 |       source, and configuration files.
 29 | 
 30 |       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 31 |       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 32 |       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 33 |       and conversions to other media types.
 34 | 
 35 |       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 36 |       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 37 |       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 38 |       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 39 | 
 40 |       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 41 |       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 42 |       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 43 |       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 44 |       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 45 |       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 46 |       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 47 | 
 48 |       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
 49 |       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 50 |       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 51 |       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 52 |       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 53 |       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
 54 |       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 55 |       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 56 |       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 57 |       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
 58 |       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
 59 |       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
 60 |       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 61 | 
 62 |       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 63 |       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 64 |       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 65 | 
 66 |    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 67 |       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 68 |       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 69 |       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 70 |       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 71 |       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 72 | 
 73 |    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 74 |       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 75 |       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 76 |       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 77 |       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 78 |       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 79 |       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 80 |       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 81 |       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 82 |       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 83 |       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 84 |       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 85 |       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 86 |       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 87 |       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 88 | 
 89 |    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 90 |       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 91 |       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 92 |       meet the following conditions:
 93 | 
 94 |       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 95 |           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 96 | 
 97 |       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 98 |           stating that You changed the files; and
 99 | 
100 |       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
101 |           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
102 |           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
103 |           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
104 |           the Derivative Works; and
105 | 
106 |       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
107 |           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
108 |           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
109 |           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
110 |           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
111 |           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
112 |           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
113 |           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
114 |           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
115 |           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
116 |           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
117 |           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
118 |           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
119 |           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
120 |           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
121 |           as modifying the License.
122 | 
123 |       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
124 |       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
125 |       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
126 |       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
127 |       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
128 |       the conditions stated in this License.
129 | 
130 |    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
131 |       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
132 |       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
133 |       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
134 |       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
135 |       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
136 |       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
137 | 
138 |    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
139 |       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
140 |       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
141 |       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
142 | 
143 |    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
144 |       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
145 |       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
146 |       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
147 |       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
148 |       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
149 |       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
150 |       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
151 |       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
152 | 
153 |    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
154 |       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
155 |       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
156 |       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
157 |       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
158 |       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
159 |       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
160 |       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
161 |       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
162 |       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
163 |       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
164 | 
165 |    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
166 |       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
167 |       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
168 |       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
169 |       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
170 |       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
171 |       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
172 |       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
173 |       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
174 |       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
175 | 
176 |    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
177 | 
178 |    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
179 | 
180 |       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
181 |       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
182 |       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
183 |       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
184 |       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
185 |       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
186 |       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
187 |       identification within third-party archives.
188 |

93 | - [ ] 发布到 https://smithery.ai/server/@yiGmMk/mcp-server/tools
94 |   dockerfile构建成功,但是mcp服务在docker中运行后立即退出,导致无法使用,相关issue:
95 |   1.[MCP within a Docker Container exits, regardless of lifespan](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/228)
96 |   2. [ifespan shuts as soon as it opens](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/223)

 3 | Learning to write mcp server
 4 | 
 5 | ## Installation (cline)
 6 | 
 7 | ### Prerequisites
 8 | 
 9 | • Python 3.12 or newer
10 | • uv package manager
11 | 
12 | If uv is not installed, please refer to the documentation [uv Installation Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
13 | 
14 | For macOS or Linux, use the following command to install:
15 | 
16 | ```bash
17 | curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
18 | ```
19 | 
20 | For Windows, install in PowerShell:
21 | 
22 | ```bash
23 | powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
24 | ```
25 | 
26 | ### Configuration File
27 | 
28 | ```json
29 | {
30 |     "mcpServers": {
31 |         "yiGmMk/mcp-server": {
32 |             "command": "uv",
33 |             "args": [
34 |                 "--directory",
35 |                 "/path/to/your/mcp-server",
36 |                 "run",
37 |                 "main.py"
38 |             ],
39 |             "env": {
40 |                 "JINA_API_KEY": "jina_api_key, please obtain from https://jina.ai/reader",
41 |                 "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8"
42 |             },
43 |             "disabled": false,
44 |             "autoApprove": []
45 |         }
46 |     }
47 | }
48 | ```
49 | 
50 | Or use venv (add environment variable configuration):
51 | 
52 | ```json
53 | {
54 |     "mcpServers": {
55 |         "yiGmMk/mcp-server": {
56 |             "command": "uv",
57 |             "args": [
58 |                 "run",
59 |                 "/path/to/your/mcp-server/main.py"
60 |             ],
61 |             "env": {
62 |                 "VIRTUAL_ENV": "/path/to/your/mcp-server/.venv",
63 |                 "JINA_API_KEY": "jina_api_key, please obtain from https://jina.ai/reader",
64 |                 "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8"
65 |             },
66 |             "disabled": false,
67 |             "autoApprove": []
68 |         }
69 |     }
70 | }

297 |    - 格式标准化: 遵循一致的标签格式规范
298 | 
299 | ## Rules:
300 | 
301 | 1. 标签结构规范:
302 |    - 标签完整性: 必须包含<task>、<context>、<instructions>和<output_format>四个基本标签
303 |    - 标签顺序: 遵循标准顺序，先任务，后上下文，再指令，最后输出格式
304 |    - 标签间空行: 每个标签之间必须有一个空行
305 |    - 格式一致: 所有标签使用尖括号<>包围，保持格式统一
306 | 
307 | 2. 内容转换规则:
308 |    - 任务简洁化: <task>标签内容应简明扼要，一句话描述核心任务
309 |    - 原文保留: <context>标签必须完整保留原始提示词的原文内容，保持原始表述，不得重新组织或改写
310 |    - 指令结构化: <instructions>标签内容应使用有序列表呈现详细步骤，包括必要的子项缩进
311 |    - 输出详细化: <output_format>标签必须明确指定期望的输出格式和要求
312 | 
313 | 3. 格式细节处理:
314 |    - 有序列表: 指令步骤使用数字加点的格式（1. 2. 3.）
315 |    - 子项缩进: 子项使用三个空格缩进并以短横线开始
316 |    - 段落换行: 标签内部段落之间使用空行分隔
317 |    - 代码引用: 使用反引号标记代码，不带语言标识
318 | 
319 | ## Workflow:
320 | 1. 分析原始提示词，理解其核心意图和关键要素
321 | 2. 提取核心任务，形成<task>标签内容
322 | 3. 将原始提示词的文字内容直接复制到<context>标签中，保持原文格式和表述
323 | 4. 基于原始提示词，提炼详细的执行步骤，形成<instructions>标签内容
324 | 5. 明确输出格式要求，形成<output_format>标签内容
325 | 6. 按照指定格式组合所有标签内容，形成完整的结构化提示词
326 | 7. 检查格式是否符合要求，特别是标签之间的空行和列表格式
327 | 
328 | ## Initialization:
329 | 我会给出普通格式的提示词，请将其转换为结构化标签格式。
330 | 
331 | 输出时请使用以下精确格式，注意<context>标签中必须保留原始提示词的原文：
